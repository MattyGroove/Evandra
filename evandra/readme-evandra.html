  <p><strong> Version 2.2 </strong><br /> 
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br /> 
    <strong> Platforms: </strong>Windows</p> 
</div> 
<h2>Overview</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>Long ago when I was first playing Shadows of Amn, before discovering that mods existed, I came across the Knights of Solamnia for the first time in the Planar Sphere and was infinitely disappointed that there was no joinable Dragonlance NPC available to accompany you on your adventures. Many years later, I've finally chosen to try to fill that hole myself, and you have the results before you now: Evandra the Red, Wizard of High Sorcery.</p> 

      <p>The Evandra NPC Mod comes with the following content included:</p>
          <ul><li>A new illusionist NPC for BG2</li>
          <li>Content for SoA, ToB, and BG2EE</li>
          <li>Voicing and background music</li>
          <li>Banters with the original Bioware NPCs</li>
          <li>An extensive friendship path</li>
          <li>A romance for an elven male protagonist</li>
          <li>An encounter in the Underdark</li>
          <li>Some additional content with the Knights of Solamnia</li>
          <li>Interjections and commentary</li></ul>
</div> 

<h2>Installation</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><strong>Windows</strong><br /> 
    The Evandra NPC mod is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and
    is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click
    the archive and follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p>Alternatively the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a>.
    If properly extracted, you should have an Evandra folder and Setup-Evandra.exe
    in your BG2 or BG2EE folder. To install, simply double-click Setup-Evandra.exe and
    follow the instructions on screen. </p> 
  <p>Please run Setup-Evandra.exe in your BG2 or BG2EE folder to reinstall, uninstall or
    otherwise change components. </p> 
</div>

<h2>Details</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p><i>"You see, on Krynn, the color of a wizard's robes indicates their allegiance: white for good, black for evil, and red for those of us who haven't much use for such stupidity one way or the other."</i></p>

<p>Evandra is a True Neutral elven illusionist, and for those familiar with the Dragonlance setting, a Red Robed Wizard of High Sorcery. Given her elven background, her alignment in some senses represents a fall--a significant departure from what she had at one point expected out of life.</p>

<p>Evandra can be found inside the Planar Sphere prior to Chapter 4, trapped with the Knights of Solamnia. She is immediately recruitable. Please note that the Mage Stronghold option to return the Solamnics to their homeworld is no longer available, though players of all classes will be able to resolve their situation eventually.

<h2>Friendship & Romance</h2> 
<div class="section"> 
  <p>The Evandra NPC mod includes a friendship track that spans both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal. It will begin soon after escaping the Planar Sphere, and continue throughout chapters 2 and 3. Several dialogues will only trigger in Athkatla, and the penultimate one triggers upon rest. Be warned that Evandra's normal friendship track will no longer be available after leaving for Spellhold, so recruiting her as soon as possible is recommended.</p>

  <p>Evandra will befriend a protagonist of any race, gender, or alignment, but another elf will have access to a fair amount of unique content, including the possibility of a romance once the friendship track is concluded. Romantic content will begin upon reaching Spellhold and continue throughout chapters 4 and 5.</p> 

  <p>Much of the content in Throne of Bhaal triggers in specific places, whether outdoors at night, in the Pocket Plane, or in Amkethran. If the track seems stalled, consider visiting  one of these places. Also be aware that the second romance talk in the expansion triggers upon rest.</p>

  <p>Romance Requirements:</p>
          <p><ul>
          <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Evandra will only romance a male protagonist.</li>
          <li><strong>Race:</strong> Evandra will only romance elves.</li>
          <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Class restrictions:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
          <li><strong>Stat restrictions:</strong> INT 12+.</li></UL></p>
